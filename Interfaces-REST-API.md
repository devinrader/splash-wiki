# REST API

[Back to README](Home)

## API principles

- Base URL on LAN: `http://splash-core.local:8080`
- All request and response bodies are JSON
- Timestamps are ISO 8601 UTC
- All responses use an envelope shape

```json
{
  "data": {},
  "error": null
}
```

## Health contract

`GET /health` returns dependency-aware service state:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "dependencies": {
    "postgres": "ok",
    "influxdb": "ok",
    "nats": "ok"
  },
  "uptime_seconds": 3600
}
```

`status` may be `ok`, `degraded`, or an HTTP `503` response if the service cannot operate.

## API design notes

- The onboarding wizard is frontend-driven and only persists actual domain objects plus `POST /setup/complete`
- Automation approval executes prebuilt normalized command intent rather than reconstructing protocol frames in the API
- Error and degraded-state UX should derive from SSE connection state and API responses rather than dedicated polling endpoints
- The initial implementation should expose enough latest-state and control
  surface to support a browser view of air temperature, water temperature, salt
  level, and pump RPM plus a controller-managed pump-circuit RPM control action
- the first Protocol Explorer implementation slice may expose `/protocol/frames`
  before broader protocol decode, annotation, and simulator endpoints are fully
  implemented
- the first saved-frame-bundle slice may remain in-memory and non-persistent as
  long as it captures recent `protocol.frame.raw` and `protocol.frame.decoded`
  traffic for one controlled experiment window
- the first annotation slice may also remain in-memory and API-local as long as
  annotations carry explicit confidence and target saved bundles or frame
  positions rather than pretending to be durable protocol truth
- the first operator-prompt slice may remain in-memory and API-local as long as
  prompts are explicitly tied to saved bundles and unresolved decoding work
- later Protocol Explorer API slices should support collaborative decoding by
  exposing annotation confidence, saved frame comparisons, and operator-needed
  prompts without bypassing the shared protocol engine
- the first manual Remote Layout request slice may expose one Explorer-only
  route that accepts a single page index and triggers a protocol-diagnostic
  request through `splash-protocol`
- the first manual raw-frame send slice may expose one Explorer-only route that
  accepts explicit lowercase hex bytes and forwards them through
  `splash-protocol` without rewriting checksums or other frame fields
- the first manual pump-info request slice may expose one Explorer-only route
  that accepts an EasyTouch pump slot selector and triggers the validated
  `0xd8` diagnostic request through `splash-protocol`
- the first manual pump-config write slice may expose one Explorer-only route
  that accepts a structured EasyTouch `0x9b` pump configuration payload and
  forwards it through `splash-protocol` without pretending the normalized
  controller-circuit `set_speed` contract is finished
- the first watch-session slice may expose explicit start and stop routes so a
  controlled “watch live frames” capture window can be preserved and later
  displayed without relying on the rolling recent-frame buffer
- watch sessions may accept an explicit event filter so Explorer can capture
  only transport-layer serial I/O such as `serial.rx.raw` and `serial.tx.raw`
  when the operator wants to inspect exactly what `splash-serial` received and
  wrote
- `/protocol/frames` may include outbound diagnostic traffic such as
  `protocol.command.encoded` and `serial.tx.raw` so Explorer can show the exact
  request bytes that were written, not only received bus frames
- `/protocol/frames` may also include derived receive-side diagnostic events
  such as `protocol.frame.unidentified` so Explorer can show bytes that were
  classified as unknown during frame assembly without mislabeling them as valid
  protocol frames
- `/protocol/frames` may also include `protocol.frame.buffered` so Explorer can
  show bytes still retained by the decoder buffer rather than implying that
  they were ignored
- browser-facing API routes should emit CORS headers compatible with the
  frontend deployment origin, including the local developer topology where the
  frontend and API run on different loopback ports

Request:

```json
{

Rules:

- Explorer-only diagnostic route
- accepts explicit lowercase hex bytes only
- does not normalize, recalculate, or rewrite protocol fields in the first
  slice
- returns transport-acceptance only; protocol-level meaning is determined later
  from observed receive-side traffic

Response:

```json
