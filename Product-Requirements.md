## Functional requirements

### Initial implementation milestone

The first end-to-end implementation of Splash should prove one complete read and
write equipment-control slice before the broader v1 surface is considered in
scope.

Initial milestone goals:

- show current air temperature in the browser
- show current water temperature in the browser
- show current salt level in the browser
- show current pump RPM in the browser
- allow the operator to change pump-circuit RPM from the browser
- persist or log enough state and command history to verify the read and write
  path end to end

This milestone is intentionally narrower than the full v1 requirements table
below. It is the first implementation target that validates:

- RS-485 read transport
- protocol decode and normalized event publication
- API and frontend state presentation
- command encode, serial write, and command-result tracking
- historical logging of the surfaced values and control actions

| Area | v1 requirements |
| --- | --- |
| Water chemistry | Log manual or sensor readings, trend chemistry over time, support chlorine and saltwater pools, prompt users to test water, record rainfall as chart context |
| Equipment management | Track equipment inventory, runtime, faults, and maintenance reminders; support equipment control through RS-485 where available |
| Seasonal workflows | Provide guided opening and closing checklists customized by pool type, region, and equipment |
| Predictive automation | Generate suggested pump and heater actions based on weather and pool state; require user approval before execution |
| Pool cover tracking | Record cover on/off events with cover type and use them to interpret chemistry and UV behavior |
| SLAM workflow | Guide the user through SLAM initiation, FC target calculation, periodic logging, OCLT, and completion criteria |
| Protocol Explorer | Provide live frame monitoring, decode tools, simulation, frame diffing, and annotation for RS-485 reverse engineering |
| Onboarding | Gate the app behind a setup wizard until pool profile and baseline setup are complete |
| Notifications | Persist and display maintenance, chemistry, seasonal, automation, and equipment-fault notifications |
| MagicMirror | Expose a read-only integration surface over REST and SSE for a future `MMM-Splash` module |

## Functional detail

### Chemistry

- Track pH, free chlorine, total alkalinity, calcium hardness, cyanuric acid, salt, and rainfall
- Allow partial chemistry entries
- Warn when both pH and free chlorine are omitted from a manual reading
- Show ideal ranges, alerts, SLAM shading, cover events, and rainfall markers on trend charts
- Use CYA-adjusted free chlorine minimums instead of relying on a single FC target

### Equipment

- Support inventory records for pump, filter, heater, lights, cleaner, and chlorinator
- Show live equipment state through SSE
- Expose command controls with loading state until `command.result`
- The first browser control surface must expose pump RPM readout and
  controller-managed pump-circuit RPM control before broader equipment-control
  coverage is considered complete
- Splash should ultimately own normal pool-equipment scheduling so the operator
  does not need to rely on EasyTouch scheduling for day-to-day pump-speed and
  related equipment schedule changes
- Splash should support a user-selectable scheduling strategy so the operator
  can choose either controller-native schedule management or Splash-native
  schedule management depending on equipment capability and preference
- when controller-native scheduling is selected, Splash should provide a way to
  view, manage, or coordinate with controller schedules rather than assuming
  Splash is always the only scheduling authority
- Log maintenance history and surface upcoming service dates
- Resolve each controllable equipment instance to zero or one capability profile in v1
- Validate UI controls and normalized commands against effective per-equipment capabilities rather than equipment type alone
- Ship an initial capability-profile catalog that includes generic fallbacks and Pentair-family v1 profiles for controller circuits, pumps, heaters, and chlorinators
- Define a machine-readable equipment-parameter documentation format that can
  describe model-specific limits, options, and inventories for supported pool
  equipment
- Use that equipment-parameter format to surface equipment limits in the Splash
  UI so both Splash and the operator understand constraints such as available
  EasyTouch 8 system circuits, valid assigned names, or supported function
  choices
- Support controller clock synchronization so Splash can set supported
  controller clocks, such as the EasyTouch clock, to the Splash system time
  when the operator chooses to keep controller-native schedules aligned

### Automation

- Evaluate weather-driven rules after each weather update
- Publish automation suggestions to NATS
- Require approve or dismiss actions from the user
- Prevent duplicate suggestions with minimum re-suggestion intervals
- Include an explainable reason string with each suggestion

### Seasonal and SLAM

- Store checklist definitions, checklist steps, and checklist completion history
- Track active SLAM sessions with all three completion criteria
- Suppress normal FC alerts during an active SLAM
- Increase chemistry-prompt cadence while SLAM is active

### Diagnostics and advanced tooling

- Stream raw RS-485 frames
- Decode known frames and annotate unknown fields
- Support collaborative protocol discovery by clearly separating decoded fields
  into `known`, `inferred`, and `unknown` confidence levels
- support saving confidence-aware annotations against saved frame bundles and
  byte ranges during collaborative decoding
- Allow Protocol Explorer to surface operator-needed questions or prompts when
  a frame cannot be safely decoded from captured traffic alone
- support saving operator-needed prompts with bundle and frame context during
  collaborative protocol decoding
- Preserve frame bundles or experiment snapshots so one controlled controller
  change can be compared against a baseline during reverse engineering
- the first frame-bundle slice may use an in-memory recent-event buffer before
  persistent Explorer storage is implemented
- the first frame-diff slice may compare saved bundles positionally and only
  highlight direct byte-level changes before richer protocol-aware diffing
  exists
- Support dry-run command simulation by default
- Require explicit confirmation for any live command transmission
- Centralize protocol decode and encode in a dedicated protocol service rather than spreading packet logic across API and scheduler
- Load protocol implementations through configuration-driven plugins
- Reuse the same protocol decode and encode engine for Protocol Explorer and production command handling
- Define explicit raw-transport, protocol-frame, and normalized-command contracts between services
- Ensure command lifecycle tracking distinguishes encode, transmit, and protocol-level completion states
- Maintain authoritative reference documentation for all known pool-equipment communication protocols, including supported, partial, and planned integrations
- Support profile-based capability mapping so protocol plugins can expose richer vendor-specific capabilities without collapsing to a lowest common denominator
- Support machine-readable equipment-parameter definitions alongside protocol
  reference docs so UI, validation, and operator guidance can share one
  structured source of truth for equipment limits
- Preserve native serial read boundaries in the raw transport contract rather than introducing frame-aware buffering in `splash-serial`
- Define an explicit transport-facing outbound write contract from `splash-protocol` to `splash-serial`
- Future platform work should support virtual or mock pool equipment so users
  can create a simulated pool for testing, demos, and protocol experimentation
  without real hardware

## Non-functional requirements

### Reliability

- Recover automatically from temporary RS-485 disconnects
- Recover automatically from NATS disconnects
- Degrade gracefully when weather data, InfluxDB, or SSE becomes stale
- Keep the app usable for read and manual-entry workflows during partial outages
- Reject stale transport write requests after serial reconnect rather than risking writes on a replaced port session

### Performance and platform constraints

- Run on Raspberry Pi hardware
- Keep `splash-serial` lightweight enough for a Pi Zero 2W
- Use Docker Compose on `splash-core`
- Use `systemd` on `splash-zero` for the installed `splash-serial` service, with package-managed deployment preferred over raw binary copy
- Keep `splash-serial` observability lightweight through a minimal local HTTP health and metrics surface
- Prefer package-based release artifacts for deployable services, including services that ultimately run inside containers
- Publish prerelease artifacts on every merge to `main` and stable artifacts on semver tags

### Maintainability

- Use a polyglot monorepo that supports TypeScript/Node.js services alongside Go for `splash-serial`
- Keep protocols behind a pluggable `ProtocolDecoder`
- Keep weather behind a pluggable `WeatherProvider`
- Keep future chemistry sensors behind a pluggable `SensorProvider`
- Favor stable event contracts and repository patterns over tight coupling
- Prefer TypeScript for JSON-heavy application services and Go only where constrained-hardware transport needs justify it
- Keep raw transport concerns, protocol concerns, and product-workflow concerns separated by contract

### Security and safety

- Treat live RS-485 command transmission as a sensitive action
- Keep LAN-only operation in v1
- Use Cloudflare Access for v2 remote access rather than building application auth first
- Store secrets in Ansible Vault

### Language and runtime fit

- `splash-serial` must remain lightweight enough for Pi Zero 2W deployment and is expected to use Go
- `splash-api`, `splash-scheduler`, and `splash-protocol` should favor TypeScript/Node.js for faster development, shared types, and better alignment with frontend and Protocol Explorer work

## Dependencies

- PostgreSQL
- InfluxDB
- NATS with JetStream
- USB-to-RS-485 adapter
- Weather provider API key
- Docker and Docker Compose on `splash-core`
- Gitea package registry for internal artifact distribution
- Ansible for provisioning and disaster recovery
- Gitea Actions secrets for non-interactive package and image publishing

## Risks

- RS-485 protocol variability across vendors and controller generations
- CYA-adjusted chemistry rules being misunderstood if surfaced without context
- SSE stability through remote-access layers such as Cloudflare Tunnel
- Embedded-device storage and log growth on Raspberry Pi deployments
- Future multi-pool support not yet implemented despite `pool_id`-ready schemas
- mDNS reliability varying by router and LAN environment
- Chemistry-sensor compatibility and ingestion reliability
- InfluxDB sustained-write performance on Raspberry Pi hardware

## Constraints

- v1 is single-pool despite multi-pool-friendly schema design
- No application-layer authentication in v1 LAN mode
- Light mode only in v1
- Full dosing math is deferred to v2
- Hayward and Jandy support are planned but not fully implemented
