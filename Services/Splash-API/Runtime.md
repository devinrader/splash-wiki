# Runtime Model

[Back to Splash API Service](./README.md)

## Process model

`splash-api` runs on `splash-core` as a TypeScript or Node.js service.

It should:

- expose LAN REST and SSE endpoints
- connect to NATS
- maintain an in-memory latest-state projection for the initial equipment slice
- publish normalized `protocol.command.intent`
- expose local dependency-aware health

## Initial runtime responsibilities

For the first browser milestone, `splash-api` should:

1. consume normalized equipment events:
   - `equipment.state.controller`
   - `equipment.state.pump`
   - `equipment.state.chlorinator`
2. maintain latest values for:
   - air temperature
   - water temperature
   - salt level
   - pump RPM
3. expose those values through REST
4. fan them out through SSE
5. accept pump-speed control requests and publish `protocol.command.intent`
6. consume `command.result.{command_id}` and relay command progress through SSE
7. expose a first Protocol Explorer frame-bundle slice by:
   - buffering recent `protocol.frame.raw`, `protocol.frame.unidentified`,
     `protocol.frame.decoded`, `protocol.command.encoded`, and `serial.tx.raw`
     events
   - allowing a client to save a bundle from that recent buffer
   - returning saved bundles through REST
8. expose a first Protocol Explorer frame-diff slice by:
   - comparing two saved bundles
   - highlighting changed byte offsets for known hex-bearing fields
   - returning the comparison through REST
9. expose a first confidence-aware annotation slice by:
   - accepting annotations tied to saved bundles and frame positions
   - preserving annotation confidence and byte ranges
   - returning saved annotations through REST
10. expose a first operator-prompt slice by:
    - accepting prompts tied to saved bundles and frame positions
    - preserving the prompt question, rationale, and expected input type
    - returning saved prompts through REST
11. expose a first manual Remote Layout request slice by:
    - accepting a single page index from Protocol Explorer
    - publishing a diagnostic `protocol.command.intent`
    - keeping the flow explicitly Explorer-only rather than normal automation
      or dashboard control
12. expose a first manual raw-frame send slice by:
    - accepting explicit lowercase hex bytes from Protocol Explorer
    - publishing a diagnostic `protocol.command.intent`
    - keeping the flow explicitly Explorer-only rather than normal automation
      or dashboard control
13. expose a first manual pump-info request slice by:
    - accepting an EasyTouch pump slot selector from Protocol Explorer
    - publishing a diagnostic `protocol.command.intent`
    - keeping the flow explicitly Explorer-only rather than normal automation
      or dashboard control
14. expose a first manual pump-config write slice by:
    - accepting a structured EasyTouch `0x9b` pump configuration payload from
      Protocol Explorer
    - publishing a diagnostic `protocol.command.intent`
    - keeping the flow explicitly Explorer-only rather than normal automation
      or dashboard control
15. expose a first watch-session slice by:
    - starting an explicit capture window
    - recording all live Explorer frame events into that watch session
    - allowing an optional per-session event filter so a watch can be limited
      to transport-only serial activity such as `serial.rx.raw` and
      `serial.tx.raw`
    - stopping and returning the captured frame set for later inspection

## Initial equipment catalog bridge

The first API slice may use a minimal local equipment catalog bridge rather than
the full PostgreSQL-backed inventory model.

Rules:

- the bridge should expose a stable API-facing `equipment_id`
- the bridge should map that id to:
  - `equipment_type`
  - `protocol_name`
  - direct pump `bus_address`
- the bridge should be limited to the initial milestone equipment targets
- the bridge should be replaceable by the later repository-backed equipment
  model without changing the public REST route shape

ASSUMPTION: the initial bridge will define one pump entry for the direct Pentair
IntelliFlo target used by the milestone-1 `set_speed` path.

ASSUMPTION: the first slice may also use a static configured `pool_id` for
command publication and latest-state projection until the repository-backed pool
model exists.

## Degraded behavior

The service should stay alive but degrade when:

- NATS is unavailable
- no latest equipment state has been observed yet
- command-result updates are temporarily unavailable

The service should fail fast when:

- static service configuration is invalid
- the HTTP bind fails

## Initial route expectations

The first slice should at least support:

- `GET /equipment`
- `POST /equipment/:id/control`
- `GET /events`
- `GET /health`
- `GET /protocol/frames`
- `GET /protocol/bundles`
- `POST /protocol/bundles`
- `GET /protocol/bundles/:id`
- `POST /protocol/bundles/compare`
- `POST /protocol/watch-sessions`
- `GET /protocol/watch-sessions/:id`
- `POST /protocol/watch-sessions/:id/stop`
- `GET /protocol/annotations`
- `POST /protocol/annotations`
- `GET /protocol/prompts`
- `POST /protocol/prompts`
- `POST /protocol/remote-layout/request`
- `POST /protocol/pump-info/request`
- `POST /protocol/pump-config/write`
- `POST /protocol/raw-frame/send`

Rules:

- `GET /equipment` may return the minimal bridged equipment model plus latest
  live state needed for the milestone
- `POST /equipment/:id/control` should only accept the normalized pump
  `set_speed` action in the first slice
- command ids should be created by `splash-api`
- command progress should be exposed through SSE `command.result`
- the first saved-frame-bundle slice may remain in-memory and non-persistent
  while Protocol Explorer is still a local protocol-discovery tool
- the first frame-diff slice may stay purely API-local and compare saved
  bundles positionally without trying to infer protocol meaning
- the first annotation slice may stay API-local and in-memory before the
  repository-backed `protocol_annotations` model is implemented
- the first operator-prompt slice may stay API-local and in-memory before a
  broader task or notification workflow exists
- the first manual Remote Layout request slice may remain a thin API-to-NATS
  bridge as long as it is explicitly scoped to Protocol Explorer diagnostics
- the first manual raw-frame send slice may remain a thin API-to-NATS bridge as
  long as it is explicitly scoped to Protocol Explorer diagnostics and does not
  silently rewrite the operator-provided bytes
- the first manual pump-info request slice may remain a thin API-to-NATS bridge
  as long as it is explicitly scoped to Protocol Explorer diagnostics
- the first manual pump-config write slice may remain a thin API-to-NATS bridge
  as long as it is explicitly scoped to Protocol Explorer diagnostics
- the first watch-session slice may stay API-local and in-memory before a
  broader persistent capture model exists
- the first watch-session filter may remain a simple explicit allowlist of
  known Explorer event names rather than a general-purpose query language
- the API should allow browser-origin requests from the frontend deployment
  origin, including the local milestone topology where `splash-frontend` runs
  on `127.0.0.1:3000` and `splash-api` runs on `127.0.0.1:8080`
